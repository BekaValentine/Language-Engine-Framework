Language Engine
===============

Language Engine is an Objective-C SDK for adding natural language
understanding to your apps. With some minor configuration, you can turn
sentences in English into structured data that you can inspect, or even
method calls to control your software directly.

Features
--------

- Custom vocabulary (syntax and semantics)
- Automatically derive nouns and verbs
- Dispatch on input (similar to Sinatra routing but for English)

Installation
------------

Install Language Engine into your Xcode projects by adding the .framework to
the project. In your build phrases, create a copy files phase, with the
destination set to Frameworks, and drag the .framework into the list.

Import Language Engine using

    #import <LanguageEngine/LanguageEngine.h>
